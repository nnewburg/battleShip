Battleship
=====================

Battleship is a classic board game created with HTML, CSS, and Jquery

A user places their ships and then clicks on a button to take turns with an opponent, a red square is a hit while a green square is a miss, for the opponents board a grey square is a miss while a red square is a hit. The game offers two difficulty levels; easy and hard.

## Missing Features

- There is a bug where AI may place their ships in a way the end and beginning of 2 seperate rows may occupy the same ship
- There is not a functionality to end the game
- There is not a functionality to announce when a single ship has been sunk
